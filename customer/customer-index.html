We love Upfront Carpet Cleaning. We had very challenging carpet stains and thought our carpet would need to be replaced. Jeff came and now it looks like brand new carpet.  Can't believe how great the whole house looks. Jeff was punctual and very professional. We were so happy with our home that we had him clean the carpets in our summer home, too.  We highly recommend Upfront Carpet Cleaning.

I highly recommend Up Front Carpet Cleaning for all your carpet and upholstery cleaning needs. I've always been completely satisfied with the job Jeff does and I truly appreciate the "no hidden charges" that I found with other companies.

In a word..excellent! The professionalism, thoroughness and attention to detail that Jeff displayed was wonderful. We had some stubborn spots on our white living room chairs, which were not a challenge to him at all. I had called around to see how much it would cost to reupholster them and it was an outrageous price. Jeff told me he would like to try to do them, and it was unbelievable the job he did to them. They went from 15 years worth of childrens dirty hands, spills, water spots etc.. to the original clean chairs I had when we bought them. Definetely will be using him again soon. Thank you UPFRONT CARPET CLEANING.

I was going thru a very difficult time in my life and had to prepare to sell my home. I had to find someone extremely cost efficient that would do an excellent job at cleaning the carpets in my house. Not only was Jeff price competitive but he did an amazing job on the carpets, not to mention that I had 4 staircases in my house that he had to work with, so it was not easy to say the least. He got me out of a huge “rut” when I needed someone right away. Between a young child and a black lab running around my house, I think you can imagine what my carpets looked like. When I went to see the house after he had completed his job I was simply amazed at how he could make it look brand new! On top of the great price, and awesome job he did, he was one of the kindest people I have ever met. I recommend him to anyone I possibly can for the unbelievable work he does.

I recently had UpFront carpet cleaning come to my home not to clean my carpet, but to clean my disgusting, stinky couch that my 3 dogs had decided was their favorite place to sleep. Not only did Jeff get that couch clean but it doesn.t smell like .dog. anymore!
Jeff showed up on time and was very easy to work with. I recommended UpFront to some of the people I work with also. I will use their services again! <br>
<br> 
Thanks Jeff! <br>
